I am a Bioinformatics Ph.D. candidate in [Dr. Vivek Swarup's lab](https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/) at the University of California, Irvine. My thesis research focuses on leveraging statistical methods and computational tools to investigate Alzheimerâ€™s disease, with the ultimate goal of discovering new therapeutic targets.

I graduated from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) with a degree in Biotechnology in 2018. Following that, I worked as a research specialist in [Dr. Lewis Chodosh's lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p20564) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I contributed to developing treatments for recurrent breast cancer. There, I conducted hands-on drug efficacy experiments and applied statistical methods to evaluate drug effects across four preclinical trials. Additionally, my undergraduate research experience includes performing tissue culture, siRNA knockdown, flow cytometry, and other molecular approaches to advance our understanding in biomedical research.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
