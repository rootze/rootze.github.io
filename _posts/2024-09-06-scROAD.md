### What We Can Do with scATAC-seq Data

scATAC-seq data enables us to explore chromatin accessibility at a single-cell level, allowing for the identification of regulatory elements that are active in specific cell types. This technique is particularly powerful for investigating transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and understanding gene regulatory networks in the context of complex diseases like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Pick's Disease (PiD).

Our comprehensive approach integrates genomic data from various sources, including GWAS fine-mapping, single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq), and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), to uncover the genetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. By mapping disease-associated loci to specific cell types, we can investigate the functional alterations due to genetic variants in disease contexts, such as AD and PiD.

I developed a wrapper package, [scCis-TF](https://github.com/rootze/scCis-TF), designed to streamline the extraction of information from single-cell data generated by CellRanger ATAC, Seurat, and Signac into Cicero and TOBIAS for comprehensive analysis. We performed single-cell co-accessibility analyses using [Cicero](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/docs_m3/) to construct putative cis-regulatory enhancer-promoter links. Additionally, with the help of the [TOBIAS](https://github.com/loosolab/TOBIAS) package, we further explored transcription factor (TF) binding occupancy in ATAC-seq. This analysis allows us to detect differences in TF binding between disease and control samples, providing insights into how regulatory mechanisms are altered in specific cell types.

By integrating TF binding data with co-accessibility analyses to create this scCis-TF interactive database, users can easily explore transcription factor binding activity and their implications in disease, providing a valuable resource for understanding gene regulation in neurodegeneration.

### About the Database

This database offers comprehensive information on single-cell cCRE transcription factor occupancy data generated from snATAC-seq analysis of human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue. The data specifically focuses on Alzheimer's Disease and Pick's Disease. For a more in-depth understanding of the database's purpose and contents, please refer to the following publication. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact the principal investigator.
